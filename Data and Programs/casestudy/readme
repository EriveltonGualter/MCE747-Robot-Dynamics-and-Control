ExtFterm.m and inv_vel_accel.m are auxiliary symbolic computation files (not necessary to simulate)

To simulate run setup and the mdl file.

The robot will bounce off the wall. 

If the wall position is moved to interfere too much with the robot's path, destabilization due
to interaction will occur. An impedance controller would offer a much better solution.
